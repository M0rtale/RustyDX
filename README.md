# RustyDX
D3D11 Rust memory read write demonstration.

All you need to add is a working Read Write solution, I have marked the place where you want to implement it with TODO: and ReadProcessMemory

This instance doesn't utilize any of the writing mechanism, just to avoid impurity checks that EAC and facepunch might have implemented.
